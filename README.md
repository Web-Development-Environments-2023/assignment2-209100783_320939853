# Music
# How we sampled someone's 8-bit song and made our own unique music for the game of Chicken Invaders

We were inspired by the classic arcade game Chicken Invaders, and wanted to create a new version of the game with our own unique sound. We sampled a portion of an 8-bit song from another artist, and used it as the basis for our own music. We added new instruments, effects, and arrangements to create a new and exciting soundtrack. We believe that our music adds to the overall experience of the game, and makes it more fun and engaging.

  * We found an 8-bit song that we liked the sound of.
  * We sampled a portion of the song and imported it into our music production software.
  * We added new instruments, effects, and arrangements to the sample.
  * We mixed and mastered the music to create a final product that we were happy with.

### We believe that our music is a unique and creative addition to the game of Chicken Invaders. We hope you enjoy it!
